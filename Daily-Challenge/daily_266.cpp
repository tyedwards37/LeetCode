/* Daily Question: 624. Maximum Distance in Arrays
 * by Tyler Edwards | August 15th, 2024 
 * Code Credit: Sachinonly__
 * You are given m arrays, where each array is sorted in ascending order.
 * You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. 
 * We define the distance between two integers a and b to be their absolute difference |a - b|.
 * Return the maximum distance. */

    int maxDistance(vector<vector<int>>& arrays) {
        int smallest = arrays[0][0];
        int biggest = arrays[0].back();
        int max_distance = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < arrays.size(); ++i) {
            max_distance = max(max_distance, abs(arrays[i].back() - smallest));
            max_distance = max(max_distance, abs(biggest - arrays[i][0]));
            smallest = min(smallest, arrays[i][0]);
            biggest = max(biggest, arrays[i].back());
