/* Daily Question: 2490. Circular Sentence
 * by Tyler Edwards | November 2nd, 2024 
 * Code Credit: tojuna
 * A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
 * - For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
 * Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.
 * A sentence is circular if:
 * - The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
 * - The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
 * For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.
 * Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false. */

        // Get the length of the sentence
        int n = sentence.size();

        // First check: Compare first and last character of sentence
        // For a circular sentence, they must match
        if(sentence[0] != sentence[n-1]) return false;

        // Iterate through the sentence, starting from index 1 to n-2
        // We don't need to check first and last characters again
        for(int i=1; i<n-1; i++){
            // When we find a space character
            if(sentence[i] == ' '){
                // Check if the character before space (last char of current word)
                // matches the character after space (first char of next word)
                if(sentence[i-1] != sentence[i+1]) return false;
            }
        }

        // If we made it through all checks, the sentence is circular
        return true;
