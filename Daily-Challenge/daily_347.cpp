/* Daily Question: 2914. Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful
 * by Tyler Edwards | November 4th, 2024 
 * Code Credit: Srinivas Bodduru
 * You are given a 0-indexed binary string s having an even length.
 * A string is beautiful if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:
 * - Each substring has an even length.
 * - Each substring contains only 1's or only 0's.
 * You can change any character in s to 0 or 1.
 * Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string s beautiful. */

            count++;
        }
