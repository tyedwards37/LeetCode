/* Daily Question: 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings
 * by Tyler Edwards | December 29th, 2024 
 * Code Credit: Akbar
 * Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:
 * - Append the character '0' zero times.
 * - Append the character '1' one times.
 * This can be performed any number of times.
 * A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).
 * Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7. */
