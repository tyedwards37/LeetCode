/* Daily Question: 802. Find Eventual Safe States
 * by Tyler Edwards | Janaury 23rd, 2025 
 * Code Credit: Kiranpal Singh
 * There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
 * The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i]
 * A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).
 * Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order. */
