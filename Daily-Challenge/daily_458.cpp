/* Daily Question: 2570. Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values
 * by Tyler Edwards | March 1st, 2025 
 * Code Credit: Yanru Cheng
 * You are given two 2D integer arrays nums1 and nums2.
 * - nums1[i] = [idi, vali] indicate that the number with the id idi has a value equal to vali.
 * - nums2[i] = [idi, vali] indicate that the number with the id idi has a value equal to vali.
 * Each array contains unique ids and is sorted in ascending order by id.
 * Merge the two arrays into one array that is sorted in ascending order by id, respecting the following conditions:
 * - Only ids that appear in at least one of the two arrays should be included in the resulting array.
 * - Each id should be included only once and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two arrays. 
 * If the id does not exist in one of the two arrays, then assume its value in that array to be 0. 
 * Return the resulting array. The returned array must be sorted in ascending order by id. */
