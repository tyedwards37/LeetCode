/* Daily Question: 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
 * by Tyler Edwards | February 26th, 2024 
 * Code Credit: nishurishabh
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
 * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
 * The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. */

 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
